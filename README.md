Demoed above is a sample of my website constructed using React and Node. 

The idea behind the design is really simple, like litteraly. I have always been a fan of power in simplicity, and I find the space outside of Earth to be incredibly awesome and epic. so I combined them to create this website :)  

Please let me know if anything seems off or just have an idea to share ~

While the project is entirely constructed by me, I must thank my friends for the wonderful color scheme and star patterns^^

furthermore, the icons can be found on materialUI and the font is bonve from google.
