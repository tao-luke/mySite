# Luke's Offical Landing Page :)

![site deme gif](./sitedemo.gif)

## Deployed on domain: [luketao.ca](http://luketao.ca)   (*adaptive on phone or computer*)



Demoed above is a sample of my website constructed using React, Node, Scss, Jquery, Babel, and Boostrap.

The idea behind the design is really simple, like literally. I have always been a fan of power in simplicity, and I think outspace is super awesome and epic. so ya,  I combined them to create this website.

Please let me know if anything seems off or just have an idea to share ~

While the project is entirely constructed by me, I must thank my gf for the wonderful color scheme and star patterns^^

furthermore, the icons can be found on materialUI and the font is bonve from google.
